### Basic Rules
- Practice involves 1 hour or more of work on weekdays.
- Mandatory time tracking in tasks (in development).
- There should always be a task in progress; if there is none, it needs to be requested.

### Calls
Each team sets its own call dates. Typically, this is twice a week.

### Working with Tasks
- Tasks requiring changes in the repository should be done in a separate branch.
- Branch names are based on the task name in the GitHub task itself.
- Task names should be in English.
- After completing the work, push the changes and create a pull request.


### How to Work with Tickets
- Every week, we hold meetings to set priorities for the next two-week sprint. During this time, you will need to complete the tasks assigned to you.
- On the board in the TO DO section, you will find your tasks. When you are ready to start working on a task, move it to the In Progress column.
- For tasks requiring changes in the repository, branches should be created according to the established rules.
- After completing a task, add a detailed description of the actions taken in the task card comments. Specify what exactly was done. If necessary, leave instructions for testing or verifying your work.
- Then move the task to the QA section of the board and remove yourself from the list of assignees for that task.
