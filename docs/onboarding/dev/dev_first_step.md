# First Steps
## Git
Learn the information here: [Git](../general/git.md) and here: [Git-LFS](../general/git_lfs.md).  
Complete the courses in the first file (one is enough, but there are more if needed).  
The result of this work should be an understanding of what it is and why it's needed, as well as some practice with your public repository on GitHub.  
This skill is __very__ important for future work.

## Methodologies
Start studying [methodologies](../general/methodology.md) such as Agile, Kanban, and Waterfall.  
The result of this work should be an understanding of project phases and how projects operate.  
This knowledge is crucial for understanding how projects work.

## Unity
Proceed with the lessons [Unity](unity/leasons.md), focusing initially on `C#` courses to learn the basics of the language.  
As you progress, you will need to create games and manage them through Git.  
Try creating new features in separate branches and merging them into the main branch.  
The result of this work should be 3 small and simple games with __different__ mechanics. All the code should be posted in your public repositories.  
This is necessary for both practice and your future portfolio.

## Game Analysis
Conduct a game analysis, which will have its own ticket.  
The analysis should include screenshots and descriptions of the game's moments.  
Focus on:
- Events triggered by triggers
- How the game starts
- How the player is introduced to the game's universe
- The dialogue system
- What the game draws the player's attention to
- How often certain events occur
- What limitations exist in the game
- (The list will be updated)

Example analysis: [Summer_of_58](../../references/game/horror/summer_of_58/Summer_of_58.md)  
The result of this work should be a filled-out document with the game analysis.  
This is necessary to understand the stages/mechanics/sequences that make up a game.  
Understanding the entire game flow, examining the details.  
In the future, this will help you think through your own story.  
This process is called Reverse Engineering.

## Project Access
Access to the project involves working on the first tasks.
