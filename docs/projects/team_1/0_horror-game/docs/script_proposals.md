# Game "███████"

## Main Proposals

### Son:
The character undergoes various personal transformations through facing all the challenges.
From a shy, bullied introvert to a cruel, embittered killer.

Due to an incomplete childhood and the lack of desired needs of any child, the son faces many discrepancies between the desired and the actual.

It would be a good decision to remove the mother from the picture, as a mother provides love and support, and in her absence, the child grows up without knowing affection and warmth.

### Mother:
The mother died under ███████ circumstances, and after this tragic event for the family, the father starts drinking heavily.

For the child, the loss of his mother is a key event in his character change and personality formation. The father, who practically gave up, did not take an active role in raising his depressed son, believing that simply going to work to provide bread at home was sufficient effort.

We could add that the mother or even the entire maternal line was involved in things ranging from simple tarot card readings for money to actual occult practices, which provided various anomalous abilities.

### Nature of Anomalies:
It is best to explain the transformation of the school and the strange events through the concept of reality shifts.

Reality shifts occur through the partial or complete merging of the fabrics of different spaces.

In our case, it could be the spirit world, the world of the dead where they rest in an eternal parallel dimension that occasionally seeps into our reality.

The seepage occurs due to the destruction or inflation of the fabric of reality, or even seepage through thin cracks in the fabric of spaces—like mirrors, cat's eyes, cemeteries, monuments, etc.

#### **!** - It is precisely the occult practices of this family that give the ability to manipulate interdimensional anomalies, and under stress, this power becomes very strong.

#### Through the anomalies, he releases creatures from the mirror world; it's unknown what this will lead to, but he is certainly the bridge between realities.

### Mini-Games and Puzzles:
Puzzles can be written on the board by a spirit-teacher from the mirror world. Through the board, we can read messages from this spirit.

In the chemistry classroom, there could be puzzles to add one atom to an educational molecular model, such as having a "2H" model and needing to add "O" to form water, after which the level could flood.

This can refer to a situation where the son did not understand how to complete this task in school because the father did not help with the "HW."

### Son's Diary:
To tell the story more easily and interestingly, we can use the "son's diary," which appears at each level-class, symbolizing what the son was thinking at that moment and what thoughts he had.

Through the notebook, we can show how his soul and consciousness gradually darkened, with more mysterious symbols appearing on the pages (occult symbols and demon drawings).

The diary can look like an open notebook with various short notes and simple childish drawings that easily describe his moral state.

### Mysterious Voice:
Logically, the mysterious voice could be the deceased mother, who helps the husband by not letting him die in the mirror world and scolding him for giving up.

### Basement:
In the basement, the materialized spirit of the mother could appear, and here could be a key dialogue where she tells him about their secret occult past and explains some of the phenomena.

She helps him understand how to move forward to save the son from the dark force.
