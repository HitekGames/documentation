### Detailed Game Analysis

In the main menu - a scene from the game  
There was also a notification that the game has auto-save  
![0](img/image.png)

Backstory immediately after the start  
![0](img/image1.png)

Then the backstory in the form of a video clip  
![0](img/image2.png)

The result of the video clip is also in text, immediately after the video  
![0](img/image3.png)

Internal dialogue in the form of text at the bottom (this is how the player learns the story)  
![0](img/image4.png)

Outside the building, there is likely a texture of a forest; no separate tree objects are visible  
![0](img/image5.png)

Interacting with objects - a brief scene (shake + sound) then the object disappears  
By default, instead of a hand, there is a small dot  
![0](img/image6.png)

The note zooms in on the screen with a translation on the right  
The first note has a hint of what will happen next in the story, time, etc.  
![0](img/image7.png)

Accidentally bumped into cans (script at the window, upon entering the zone)  
About 10 seconds later, there is a sound from the other side of the room  
![0](img/image8.png)

An interesting moment: since the note is on the inside of the door, when he entered the room, he didn't see it but saw it on the return trip.  
![0](img/image9.png)

Here too, zooming and translation  
![0](img/image10.png)

When he returned to the starting room, there were sounds as if someone was trying to open the door  
Knocking and so on  
The sound continues until he approaches the door  
![0](img/image11.png)

Out of confusion about what to do, he checks the switch for the light, commented that there is no fuse  
But then he went to the bathroom, and there was a rabbit (horror element)  
![0](img/image12.png)

Then he went to where he knocked over the cans (the location is small, it is acceptable to wander around the level)  
A script for a sound in the main room triggered

On the way back, a ball rolled out in front of him, supposedly thrown by the rabbit?  
The ball from the bathroom rolled to the door, he approached the ball, and there was a loud noise behind him as if something fell (possibly a cat, as there was a meow)  
At this point, it starts to get a bit nauseating from the number of scripts  
![0](img/image13.png)

Entering the room with the cat, a message appeared about preparing for the night  
![0](img/image14.png)

Where the cat knocked things over, he found candles (they became available)  
And approaching them, there was an alarm sound outside...  
![0](img/image15.png)

At this point, the first photos appeared (old ones?)  
Photos can be rotated  
![0](img/image16.png)

On the way back, another photo was found, but in a hard-to-reach place  
![0](img/image17.png)

Approaching the place with the candles (strange that they are already there), the camera AUTO-FOCUSED on them with a message  
![0](img/image18.png)

In the very beginning, items were found on the bench  
![0](img/image19.png)

A camera with night vision was found  
![0](img/image20.png)

Later, he found a lighter near a "no smoking" sign - a kind of hint on where to look, interesting that he didn't find it earlier  
Immediately after that, there was a jump scare with crows outside the window  
![0](img/image21.png)

After the dictionary, newspapers became available??
![0](img/image22.png)

Lighting candles - by crouching and aiming  
![0](img/image23.png)

After the candles - a suggestion to lay out the sleeping bag  
![0](img/image24.png)

When clicking on the sleeping bag - scene transition  
![0](img/image25.png)

After the scene transition, very little is visible due to the candles, only the camera is actually visible  
After getting it, he can move adequately only with it  
![0](img/image26.png)

A new note is in a prominent place  
The location has also changed slightly  
![0](img/image27.png)

The location is smaller now, missing the room with the cat...  
After entering the bathroom, a new note appeared on the window  
comment at the bottom of the screen  
![0](img/image28.png)

Another photo was found near the previous one  
Again, mentioning - new elements were added, and some changed locations...  
![0](img/image29.png)

After the bathroom, he tried to open the door, and it opened  
Walking further down the corridor with the cat, one of the doors was knocked on  
![0](img/image30.png)

After wandering a bit, he walked into the main room, and upon entering the bathroom, he heard loud footsteps above his head  
![0](img/image31.png)

He checked the bathroom - nothing  
Leaving it, a can was thrown from the cat's room  
![0](img/image32.png)

Entering the room, the RABBIT appeared  
Approaching closer, something behind him made a scary sound again  
If you go further to the window, there will be another scary sound  
The door locked when he was returning to see what it was  
![0](img/image33.png)

Trying to open the door, the rabbit disappeared (the door moves but doesn't open)  
After about 20-30 seconds of wandering - a script with the camera and a loud sound, like interference  
The script triggered when he walked from the door towards the window, as the door then opened  
He received a call after the script, indicating it was time to go to the main room  
![0](img/image34.png)

Returning to the room, he immediately saw a little girl near the candles  
![0](img/image35.png)

Approaching closer, the lights went out (she extinguished the candles), and the phone ringing stopped  
Then there is a sound as if he was stunned  
And the third scene begins!!!

The start of a new scene with a comment and a dark screen  
![0](img/image36.png)

In the third scene, two more rooms that were previously locked were opened  
It is clear that the level is being revealed in stages  
![0](img/image37.png)

Lost the camera again...  
In the new locations - new photos  
![0](img/image38.png)

Entering the main room while searching for the camera, the main camera slowly focused on it on the floor with a comment below  
![0](img/image39.png)
